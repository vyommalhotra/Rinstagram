### Rinstagram is a fully functioning CLI local social media concept. 

It is designed to work as a hybrid between Instagram and Reddit used for anonymous text-based communication amongst users.

Each user can follow topics that they wish to see posts on. These topics are created by
users. A user can also follow other users without their permission (this is an intended feature
similar to Reddit). A user cannot see who they are being followed by and as such all their
posts are technically public.

All topics are public and can be followed by any user. A user can create a post under a topic
as long as they are following that topic. A user can find new users to follow by looking at
posts in a topic that they are following.
